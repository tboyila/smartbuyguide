          <p class="mb-3">
            SmartBuyGuide integrates TikTok Login Kit and the TikTok Content Posting API to enable seamless product
            sharing and user authentication.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            By clicking the <strong>“Login with TikTok”</strong> button, you initiate TikTok’s OAuth 2.0 flow and
            authorize SmartBuyGuide to access your basic TikTok profile information, including username, display name,
            and profile picture. You acknowledge that this access is required to provide personalized features and
            saved preferences within the Service.

            When you use the <strong>“Share to TikTok”</strong> or <strong>“Post to TikTok”</strong> functionality on
            product detail pages, you instruct SmartBuyGuide to create and publish content to your TikTok account via
            the TikTok Content Posting API. You are solely responsible for the content you create and publish,
            including product recommendations, images, captions, and hashtags.

            consent and action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your use of TikTok Login Kit and the Content Posting API is also subject to TikTok’s own terms of service,
            community guidelines, and policies. You agree to comply with all applicable TikTok terms when using these
            integrations through SmartBuyGuide.
