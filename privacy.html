          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">14. TikTok Login Kit and Content Posting API Data Use</h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            SmartBuyGuide integrates TikTok Login Kit and the TikTok Content Posting API to enable seamless product
            sharing and user authentication.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            When you choose to authenticate using the <strong>“Login with TikTok”</strong> button, we receive your
            basic TikTok profile information, including username, display name, and profile picture, as permitted by
            TikTok’s OAuth 2.0 flow. We use this information to create and maintain your account, personalize your
            experience, and display your profile details within SmartBuyGuide.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            When you click the <strong>“Share to TikTok”</strong> or <strong>“Post to TikTok”</strong> buttons on a
            product detail page, you can create content that includes product images, review text, captions, and
            hashtags. Upon your explicit confirmation, the TikTok Content Posting API publishes this content directly
            to your TikTok profile as a photo or video post. The post may include product details and affiliate
            information.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            All TikTok-related actions are user-initiated. We do not automatically post content to TikTok without your
            explicit consent and action. We may store metadata related to your TikTok posts (such as timestamps,
            associated product IDs, and affiliate tracking information) for analytics, troubleshooting, and to improve
            our Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your use of TikTok Login Kit and the Content Posting API is also subject to TikTok’s own privacy policy and
            terms. We encourage you to review TikTok’s policies to understand how they process your data.
